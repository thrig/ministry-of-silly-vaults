sample code for determining when things get to move, for when something
more complicated than "everything moves once each turn" is desired

tl;dr you probably want a "cost" or integer based energy system (the
files cost, energy.c, or integer-energy.lisp), unless someone else has
found something better

a circular buffer can be fast, but falls apart if you want mages who can
cast haste spells on other things, and you want that spell to have an
immediate effect on the target, which is what players will most likely
expect to happen. cost based systems handle such mages without problems
